**Project Proposal: Lap Time Analysis Tool for Strava Activity Streams using Rust**

*Overview:*
The objective of this semester-long project is to develop a lap time analysis tool for Strava activity streams using the Rust programming language. The tool will interact with the Strava API to pull down activity stream data, specifically focusing on distance and time streams. The primary functionality involves processing this data to determine lap splits, allowing users to specify lap lengths (mile and 1k laps). The processed data will then be compiled and exported into a structured JSON file for further analysis.

*Basic Features:*
The basic version of the tool will include the ability to authenticate and retrieve activity stream data from Strava, calculate lap splits based on user-specified parameters, and generate a JSON output file. Users will have a simple command-line interface to input preferences and initiate the analysis.

*Stretch Goals:*
Several additional features can enhance the tool's functionality and usability. These stretch goals include implementing a feature to aggregate and summarize lap time data from multiple activity files within a specified directory. Another stretch goal is to create visualizations that illustrate trends in lap times over time, providing users with a more comprehensive understanding of their performance.

*Resources:*
To achieve these goals, relevant resources include the official Strava API documentation for understanding authentication and retrieving activity streams. The Rust programming language documentation and relevant crates (e.g., reqwest for HTTP requests, serde for JSON serialization) will be utilized for efficient development. Additionally, tutorials on data visualization libraries in Rust, such as Plotters, can aid in implementing the stretch goal of creating visual trends.

*Related Prior Art:*
While no specific Rust-based lap time analysis tools for Strava data may exist, there are analogous applications in other languages. For instance, Python-based tools like StravaToGPX offer similar functionalities. Studying these applications can provide insights into data processing and user interface design.

In conclusion, this project aims to deliver a robust lap time analysis tool for Strava activity streams, with a focus on simplicity, accuracy, and extensibility. The proposed stretch goals add depth and value to the tool, offering users a comprehensive solution for analyzing and visualizing their performance data.
